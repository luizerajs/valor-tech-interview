## ‚úèÔ∏è Feedback on the challenge

I found it very interesting to work with Zephyr Cloud, having such an easy and practical deployment process is truly enjoyable and valuable in daily development. The challenge was practical and aligned with real-world scenarios, and the Zephyr documentation is clear. 

If I had more time to improve the implementation, I would:

* Further separate responsibilities across the codebase
* Refine the remote URL flow for better maintainability
* Apply additional refactoring to each Webpack configuration file
